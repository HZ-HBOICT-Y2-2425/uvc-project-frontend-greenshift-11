# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.

## GreenShift: Personal Carbon Footprint Awareness Through Gamified Engagement

**GreenShift** is an innovative application designed to help users become more aware of their carbon footprint in a unique, interactive, and personal way. By transforming environmental awareness into an engaging experience, GreenShift motivates you to make more eco-friendly choices and see the results in real time.

### How It Works

At the core of GreenShift is your **virtual garden**, which visually represents your real-life CO₂ footprint. The state of your garden reflects your consumption habits:

- **High Carbon Consumption**: When your carbon usage is high, your garden becomes less vibrant, with fewer flowers and a more barren appearance.
- **Low Carbon Consumption**: As you reduce your footprint, your garden flourishes, becoming more lush and colorful, showcasing your progress toward a greener lifestyle.

This dynamic transformation serves as a daily reminder of your impact on the environment, encouraging ongoing, sustainable improvements.

### Daily Tasks for a Sustainable Lifestyle

GreenShift offers **daily tasks** tailored to help you reduce your carbon footprint. These tasks vary from educational activities, such as reading articles, to actionable items like changing your air conditioner filter. Completing daily tasks allows you to build and maintain a **streak**—a key aspect of staying consistent in your journey. Maintaining a 10-day streak grants a **multiplier bonus** on your earned in-game currency, boosting your progress. For example, if you typically earn 3 units of currency for a task, a streak multiplier (e.g., 3 x 1.2) increases your rewards after consistent engagement.

### Personalization and Articles

GreenShift provides personalized **CO₂-related articles** based on your preferences. Upon your first login, you’ll answer a few questions to tailor the content to your interests. This ensures that every article you encounter is relevant and engaging, enhancing your awareness journey.

### Track and Improve Your Household Carbon Usage

The **CO₂ Page** is where GreenShift truly brings your data to life. Add details about your household appliances, like a dishwasher you use daily, to monitor your carbon footprint without repetitive logging. The app tracks your usage patterns and provides insights, helping you see whether you’re making progress or need to improve. Your garden’s condition adapts accordingly, reflecting your lifestyle changes.

### In-Game Currency and Garden Customization

As you complete tasks and reduce your carbon footprint, you earn **in-game currency** that can be used to customize and beautify your garden. Personalize your garden to create a unique space that mirrors your journey toward a more sustainable lifestyle.
